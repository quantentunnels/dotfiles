# TODO list #
* add ~/bin to repo !!!!
* install Vundle for vim from makesymlinks.sh
* install vim spellfiles? If so, maybe move vim config to own install script which gets called
* if possible install solarized color palettes for 'dircolors' and the terminal (so it works on remote terms)
* check tmux colors/bold font on urxtv
* incorporate matlab lint into vims make system
